SCScheduler
===========

adding rudimentary AppleScript scheduling to SelfControl

How to properly set it up:

1) Edit the script file to suit your needs. By default, it'll check if it's after 3:05 during Mon.-Fri. and then give 3 hours of SelfControl. -- I'll work on an easier gui sometime...

2) In System Preferences, go to Users & Groups and edit your login items (click the +):
